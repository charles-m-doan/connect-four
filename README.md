### Other random info

I wrote this back in college for a computer science course. The requirements were to implement command-line tic-tac-toe with an AI, but I thought that was too boring and went for the extra credit. The extra credit was to do the same thing, but for Connect Four instead. Creating a graphical user interface wasn't part of the requirements, but I wanted to give it a try. I've since learned a lot more about java and programming in general, so I may update this project in the future to be a bit more interesting.
